# I Can Code This All Day

I initially dedicated this project to Captain America (my favorite Marvel hero) as a fun way to practice coding while on the job hunt. Somewhere along the way, it morphed into a personal time capsule of my remaining time in the US before I move to Korea. Fittingly, Cap still feels like the right guardian for this little archive.

It's still very much a work in progress, so view the code at your own risk, just don't judge me like Tony Stark would.
